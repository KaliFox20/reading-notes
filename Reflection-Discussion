# What I Learned in Class 2FEB21


One of the things that I learned in this bootcamp is how many tools that are available to help software developers. There are so many tools that its really overwhelming and is still making my head spin

Another piece of knowledge that I learned is that in this industry you rarely ever code alone. There is alot more team oriented stuff that I wasn't aware of and its pretty cool to know that. 

Lastly I also learned that configuring your computer to be a developing can be a real pain in the butt if you have a windows computer.
