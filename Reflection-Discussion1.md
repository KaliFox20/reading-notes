## Markdown Basic Syntax

I Learned that in Markdown you can place Headers(kinda like Titles) for you webpage my Placeing "#" marks in front of what the Title of your article that you want to post. 
You can make smaller Headers by adding more "#"'s for example; one "#" would be the biggest while "##" would be a size smaller.
Another Thing I learned in Markdown is that is how to make text **bold**. How to do this is that you type in "**" before and after the word you want to make bold.

## GitHub Pages 

Lastly I also Learned that Github is an amazing site that allows you to test and create your own website/repositories to do whatever your imagination can come up with.
